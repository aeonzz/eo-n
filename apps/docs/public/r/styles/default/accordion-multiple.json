With the multiple prop, you can expand as many accordion items as\r\n          you want simultaneously. Try opening all three sections at once to see\r\n          how it works.\r\n        </AccordionContent>\r\n      </AccordionItem>\r\n      <AccordionItem>\r\n        <AccordionTrigger>How is this different from default?</AccordionTrigger>\r\n        <AccordionContent>\r\n          The default accordion only allows one item to be open at a time. When\r\n          you open a new item, the previously opened one automatically closes.\r\n          This multiple variant keeps all opened items expanded.\r\n        </AccordionContent>\r\n      </AccordionItem>\r\n      <AccordionItem>\r\n        <AccordionTrigger>When should I use this?</AccordionTrigger>\r\n        <AccordionContent>\r\n          Use the multiple variant when users might need to compare content\r\n          across different sections, or when the information in each section is\r\n          independent and doesn't require exclusive focus.\r\n        </AccordionContent>\r\n      </AccordionItem>\r\n    </Accordion>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n",
