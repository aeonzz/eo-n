      <Accordion>
        <AccordionItem value="item-1">
          <AccordionTrigger>Is it accessible?</AccordionTrigger>
          <AccordionContent>
            Yes. It adheres to the WAI-ARIA design pattern and is fully keyboard
            navigable. The component is built with proper focus management and
            ARIA attributes for screen reader compatibility.
          </AccordionContent>
        </AccordionItem>
        <AccordionItem value="item-2">
          <AccordionTrigger>Is it styled?</AccordionTrigger>
          <AccordionContent>
            Yes. The component comes with default styling using Tailwind CSS
            classes, but you can easily customize it to match your design
            system. The animation is handled through CSS transitions for smooth
            open/close interactions.
          </AccordionContent>
        </AccordionItem>
        <AccordionItem value="item-3">
          <AccordionTrigger>Is it responsive?</AccordionTrigger>
          <AccordionContent>
            Absolutely. The accordion adapts to different screen sizes and works
            well on both desktop and mobile devices. The content area smoothly
            expands and collapses regardless of the amount of content inside.
          </AccordionContent>
        </AccordionItem>
      </Accordion>
    </ComponentCard>
