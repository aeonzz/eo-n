A versatile collection of accessible and customizable UI primitives designed to help you build components tailored to your needs. This framework provides the flexibility to create and refine your own component library while ensuring seamless integration with your design system.

Featuring [shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/), known for its modern aesthetics and elegant design, and [Base UI](https://base-ui.com/), which offers highly flexible, themeable components, this toolkit empowers developers to craft intuitive and visually cohesive interfaces effortlessly.

With full control over styling and behavior, you can modify, extend, and adapt each component to fit your project’s unique requirements—without the constraints of a traditional component library.

This is not a component library. It is how you build your component library.

### Getting Started

To begin, follow the [installation guide](https:/eo-n.vercel.app/docs/ui/installation) and set up your project with shadcn and Base UI.
