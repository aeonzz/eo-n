A versatile collection of accessible and customizable UI primitives designed to help you build components tailored to your needs. This framework provides the flexibility to create and refine your own component library while ensuring seamless integration with your design system.

Featuring [shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/), known for its modern aesthetics and elegant design, and [Base UI](https://base-ui.com/), which offers highly flexible, themeable components, this toolkit empowers developers to craft intuitive and visually cohesive interfaces effortlessly.

With full control over styling and behavior, you can modify, extend, and adapt each component to fit your project’s unique requirements—without the constraints of a traditional component library.

### Why Choose This Framework?

- **Customization Without Limits** – Modify every aspect of your components to match your brand and design system.
- **Optimized Performance** – Thanks to tree-shaking, only the components you use are included in your final bundle.
- **Seamless Integration** – Easily integrates with modern frameworks and tools for a smooth development experience.
- **Accessibility First** – Built with accessibility best practices to ensure an inclusive user experience.

This approach gives you the best of both worlds: the convenience of pre-built UI primitives and the freedom to shape your components exactly how you need them.

### Getting Started

To begin, follow the [installation guide](https:/eo-n.vercel.app/docs/ui/installation) and set up your project with ShadCN and Base UI. Explore the documentation to see how you can start building with these powerful UI primitives.
