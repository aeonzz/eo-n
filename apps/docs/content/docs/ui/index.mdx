A versatile collection of accessible and customizable UI primitives designed to help you build components tailored to your needs. This framework provides the flexibility to create and refine your own component library while ensuring seamless integration with your design system.

Featuring [shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/), known for its modern aesthetics and elegant design, and [Base UI](https://base-ui.com/), which offers highly flexible, themeable components, this toolkit empowers developers to craft intuitive and visually cohesive interfaces effortlessly.

With full control over styling and behavior, you can modify, extend, and adapt each component to fit your project's unique requirementsâ€”without the constraints of a traditional component library.

This is not a component library. It is how you build your component library.

### Why Base UI?

Base UI provides a solid foundation for building custom components with several key advantages:

- **Unstyled by Default**: Components come without any styling, giving you complete control over appearance and behavior
- **Highly Customizable**: Extensive theming capabilities allow you to create consistent design systems
- **Accessibility Built-in**: All components follow WAI-ARIA guidelines and best practices for accessibility
- **Composable Architecture**: Components are built from smaller, reusable pieces that can be mixed and matched
- **TypeScript Support**: Full type safety and excellent developer experience
- **Performance Optimized**: Lightweight and efficient components that don't bloat your bundle

Base UI serves as the perfect complement to shadcn's styled components, offering the flexibility to create truly unique interfaces while maintaining the quality and accessibility standards your users expect.

### Getting Started

To begin, follow the [installation guide](https:/eo-n.vercel.app/docs/ui/installation) and set up your project with shadcn and Base UI.
